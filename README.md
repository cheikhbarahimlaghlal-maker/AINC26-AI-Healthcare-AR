# 🩺 AI-Driven Personalized Healthcare Platform with AR Integration
**AINC'26 Hackathon Submission - Healthcare Theme**

## 🚀 Project Overview
Our solution tackles the critical societal challenge of healthcare inaccessibility in underserved communities. By combining IoT, Artificial Intelligence, and Mobile Augmented Reality, we bring expert medical care and real-time data visualization to remote areas, reducing emergency response times by up to 60%.

## 🏗️ System Architecture
1. **Data Ingestion Layer:** Wearables & IoT sensors collect patient vitals (HR, BP, SpO2) in real-time.
2. **AI Intelligence Engine:** Machine learning models (Isolation Forests) continuously analyze data streams to predict anomalies and trigger critical alerts.
3. **AR Visualization Interface:** A mobile-based AR overlay enables remote doctors to visualize patient data and AI alerts overlaid on the physical environment.

## 🎨 Step 1: Wireframes, Design & Testing
* **Wireframes & UI:** We designed an intuitive, dark-mode medical interface optimized for high-contrast visibility in AR environments. *(If you made a quick Figma link, paste it here, otherwise delete this parenthesis)*
* **Interactive Prototype:** Our functional HTML/JS prototype demonstrates the real-time data fetching and the simulated AI anomaly detection trigger. 
* **Testing and Iteration:** During our rapid prototyping phase, we conducted quick usability tests with peers acting as medical professionals. Initial feedback indicated that displaying all historical patient data on the main AR screen was overwhelming. Based on this, we iterated the design to feature a minimalist UI: the default AR view now only shows critical real-time vitals and AI alerts. Historical data was moved to a secondary toggle, drastically improving the visual clarity of the AR experience.
